		Blockate Audio Database - Terms of Service
	</h1>
	<p class="mb-4"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 13, 2025</p>

	<p class="mb-6">
		Welcome to the Blockate Audio Database. By using Blockate Audio Database (the "App"), you agree
		to the following terms and conditions.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-2 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our Privacy
		Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, do not use the App.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-2 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">2. OAuth2 Authentication and Data Use</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		The App uses OAuth2 authentication to verify your identity when logging in. During this process,
		the App only collects and stores your user ID to check whether you are part of an authorized
		list of users. We do not access, store, or process any other personal or sensitive data from
		your OAuth2 account.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-2 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">3. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		The sole purpose of collecting your user ID is to verify your access rights and determine if you
		are authorized to manage the audio database. We do not share, sell, or use your OAuth2 data for
		any other purposes.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-2 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">4. Access and Management</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		As an authorized user, you may be granted permission to manage, add, edit, or delete entries in
		the Blockate Audio Database. Your access rights are strictly based on your user ID, and any
		unauthorized attempts to alter or manipulate the database may result in the revocation of
		access.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-2 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">5. Security and Privacy</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		We are committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of your data. However, by using
		this App, you acknowledge that no system is completely secure, and you agree to use the App at
		your own risk. We make reasonable efforts to safeguard your OAuth2 data but are not liable for
		any unauthorized access or breach.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-2 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">6. Limitations of Liability</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		The App is provided "as-is," and we make no representations or warranties regarding its
		functionality, security, or availability. We are not liable for any direct, indirect,
		incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the App.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-2 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">7. Changes to Terms of Service</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms of Service at any time. Any changes will be
		posted with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after such changes will
		constitute your acceptance of the new terms.
	</p>

	<h2 class="mb-2 mt-6 text-2xl font-semibold">8. Termination of Access</h2>
	<p class="mb-4">
		We reserve the right to revoke your access to the App at any time, for any reason, including but
		not limited to violation of these terms, security concerns, or if your user ID is no longer
		authorized.
	</p>
